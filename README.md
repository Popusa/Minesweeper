<h3> Description </h3>
  This was a personal project I made to refresh my java skills after learning its fundamentals in university.
  Simply, it's an 18x18 grid of minesweeper that has all of the minesweeper rules and nuances we love but with the following (small) changes:
  
  
  1. There is no timer or stopwatch
  2. The color scheme is different
  3. The "flag tile" option puts an "F" instead of a flag image 

  I decided to work on this project to brush up on my java skills as well as to practice implementing an algorithm I did not study or hear of before which was the      flood-fill algorithm that is used to clear empty spaces when the user clicks on a board tile.
  For future updates, I might implement a timer so the user can keep track of their progress and see if they get better. Also, I might add a flag inplace of the "F" character that is used to flag tiles.
